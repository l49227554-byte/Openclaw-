The Compose command table that replaced ClawDock, the operational accordions, and how published images are refreshed. Part of the [Docker](/install/docker) guide.

## ClawDock migration

ClawDock has been removed. Use Docker Compose directly for day-to-day operations.
Existing copies downloaded with `curl` are not automatically uninstalled. Remove
the `source ~/.clawdock/clawdock-helpers.sh` line from your shell startup file
(`~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`), then start a new shell. If you sourced a checkout copy
from `scripts/clawdock/` or the older `scripts/shell-helpers/` path, remove that
source line instead. Keep your OpenClaw state, credentials, workspace, project
`.env`, and volumes.

Run commands from the directory containing your `docker-compose.yml`. **Keep the
same Compose file set and order on every command** so mounts and settings remain
intact. With default file discovery, Compose loads `docker-compose.override.yml`
automatically when present. Extra and sandbox files need explicit `-f` options;
when using `-f`, include the standard override too if you use one. For example,
if your deployment uses all four files:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml \
  -f docker-compose.extra.yml -f docker-compose.sandbox.yml ps
```

Use only the files your deployment already uses. The commands below show the
default file set; insert your existing `-f` options after `docker compose` when
needed. See [Manual flow](/install/docker#manual-flow) for setup and extra mounts.

| Task             | Command                                                            |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Start            | `docker compose up -d openclaw-gateway`                            |
| Stop the stack   | `docker compose down`                                              |
| Restart          | `docker compose restart openclaw-gateway`                          |
| Container status | `docker compose ps`                                                |
| Follow logs      | `docker compose logs -f openclaw-gateway`                          |
| Gateway shell    | `docker compose exec openclaw-gateway bash`                        |
| CLI              | `docker compose run --rm openclaw-cli <command>`                   |
| Dashboard URL    | `docker compose run --rm openclaw-cli dashboard --no-open`         |
| List devices     | `docker compose run --rm openclaw-cli devices list`                |
| Approve a device | `docker compose run --rm openclaw-cli devices approve <requestId>` |
| Inspect config   | `docker compose run --rm openclaw-cli config get <path>`           |

Start the gateway before using the shell or CLI commands. For a custom host port,
adjust the printed dashboard URL as described in [Containerized Gateway](/install/docker#containerized-gateway).
Use [Health checks](/install/docker#health-checks) to verify the gateway and
[Update OpenClaw](/install/docker-vm-runtime#update-openclaw) for image updates.

Token setup belongs to the [Docker setup flow](/install/docker#containerized-gateway).
If you need the Control UI token, read `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` privately from the
project `.env`. [`config get <path>`](/cli/config) redacts sensitive values; it
does not reveal the full token.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Enable agent sandbox for Docker gateway">
    ```bash
    export OPENCLAW_SANDBOX=1
    ./scripts/docker/setup.sh
    ```

    Custom socket path (e.g. rootless Docker):

    ```bash
    export OPENCLAW_SANDBOX=1
    export OPENCLAW_DOCKER_SOCKET=/run/user/1000/docker.sock
    ./scripts/docker/setup.sh
    ```

    The script mounts `docker.sock` only after sandbox prerequisites pass. If sandbox setup can't complete, it resets `agents.defaults.sandbox.mode` to `off`. Codex code mode is disabled for turns where the OpenClaw sandbox is active (see [Sandboxing § Docker backend](/gateway/sandboxing#docker-backend)); never mount the host Docker socket into agent sandbox containers.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Automation / CI (non-interactive)">
    Disable Compose pseudo-TTY allocation with `-T`:

    ```bash
    docker compose run -T --rm openclaw-cli gateway probe
    docker compose run -T --rm openclaw-cli devices list --json
    ```

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Shared-network security note">
    `openclaw-cli` uses `network_mode: "service:openclaw-gateway"` so CLI commands can reach the gateway over `127.0.0.1`. Treat this as a shared trust boundary. The compose config drops `NET_RAW`/`NET_ADMIN` and enables `no-new-privileges` on both `openclaw-gateway` and `openclaw-cli`.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Docker Desktop DNS failures in openclaw-cli">
    Some Docker Desktop setups fail DNS lookups from the shared-network `openclaw-cli` sidecar after `NET_RAW` is dropped, showing up as `EAI_AGAIN` during npm-backed commands like `openclaw plugins install`. Keep the default hardened compose file for normal operation. The override below restores default capabilities for the `openclaw-cli` container only — use it for the one-off command that needs registry access, not as your default invocation:

    ```bash
    printf '%s\n' \
      'services:' \
      '  openclaw-cli:' \
      '    cap_drop: !reset []' \
      > docker-compose.cli-no-dropped-caps.local.yml

    docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.cli-no-dropped-caps.local.yml run --rm openclaw-cli plugins install <package>
    ```

    If you already created a long-running `openclaw-cli` container, recreate it with the same override — `docker compose exec`/`docker exec` can't change Linux capabilities on an already-created container.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Permissions and EACCES">
    The container runs as uid 1000 by default (the image's `node` user). If you see permission errors on `/home/node/.openclaw`, pick the branch that matches your host storage:

    **You control the host directories** (local disk, most VPS/root-accessible setups) — chown them to match the container default:

    ```bash
    sudo chown -R 1000:1000 /path/to/openclaw-config /path/to/openclaw-workspace
    ```

    **You cannot change the ownership** (shared storage, an owner you don't control, a uid policy you can't change) — set `OPENCLAW_PUID`/`OPENCLAW_PGID` in `.env` to the directory's own uid/gid instead. `scripts/docker/setup.sh` validates and persists these (decimal only, `0` rejected, max `65533`); both `openclaw-gateway` and `openclaw-cli` pick them up from `.env` on the next `docker compose up -d`. See [Running as a different uid](#running-as-a-different-uid) for the full recipe and its limitations.

    The same mismatch can show up as `blocked plugin candidate: suspicious ownership (... uid=1000, expected uid=0 or root)` followed by `plugin present but blocked` — the process uid and the mounted plugin directory owner disagree; apply whichever branch above matches your storage. Only chown `/path/to/openclaw-config/npm` to `root:root` if you intentionally run OpenClaw as root long term.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Faster rebuilds">
    Use the repo-root `Dockerfile` instead of replacing it with a shortened
    single-stage example. Its `workspace-deps` stage extracts the package
    manifests required by `pnpm-workspace.yaml`. Build and production dependency
    stages share those inputs and run separate frozen-lockfile installs. This
    keeps both dependency layers cacheable without omitting `packages/*`, selected
    `extensions/*`, or other required workspace metadata.

    The `runtime-assets` stage inherits `production-deps` and overlays `/app`
    from `runtime-build-output`, a copy of `build` with dependency trees removed.
    This reuses the fresh production install's layers while preserving compiled
    workspace packages and native addon outputs. It does not run `pnpm prune`
    on dependencies inherited from an image layer; pnpm 12 can fail that operation
    with `EXDEV` on OverlayFS. The `build` target retains development dependencies
    for live-test containers.

    The same Dockerfile preserves the production runtime contract: digest-pinned
    Node and Bun bases, a non-root user (uid 1000 by default), `tini`, the built-in health check, and
    the `/usr/local/bin/openclaw` symlink. Dependabot refreshes the reviewed base
    digests; do not replace them with floating `FROM node:24-bookworm` tags.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Power-user container options">
    The default image is security-first and runs as non-root `node`. For a more full-featured container:

    1. **Persist `/home/node`**: `export OPENCLAW_HOME_VOLUME="openclaw_home"`
    2. **Bake system deps**: `export OPENCLAW_IMAGE_APT_PACKAGES="git curl jq"`
    3. **Bake Python deps**: `export OPENCLAW_IMAGE_PIP_PACKAGES="requests==2.32.5 humanize==4.14.0"`
    4. **Bake Playwright Chromium**: `export OPENCLAW_INSTALL_BROWSER=1`, or use the official `-browser` image tag
    5. **Persist browser downloads and caches**: use `OPENCLAW_HOME_VOLUME` or `OPENCLAW_EXTRA_MOUNTS`. OpenClaw auto-detects the image's Playwright-managed Chromium on Linux.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="OpenAI Codex OAuth (headless Docker)">
    If you pick OpenAI Codex OAuth in the wizard, it opens a browser URL. In Docker or headless setups, copy the full redirect URL you land on and paste it back into the wizard to finish auth.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Base image metadata">
    The runtime image uses `node:24-bookworm-slim` and runs `tini` as PID 1 so zombie processes are reaped and signals handled correctly in long-running containers. It publishes OCI base-image annotations including `org.opencontainers.image.base.name` and `org.opencontainers.image.source`. Dependabot refreshes the pinned Node base digest, and each build applies current Debian point-release updates. See [OCI image annotations](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/annotations.md).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Running as a different uid

Docker bind mounts carry ownership numerically: the container sees the host's
uid and gid, never its user names. A write succeeds only when the container's
uid owns the mounted directory, or reaches it through its gid. The image runs
as uid 1000, so any host whose directories belong to a different uid runs into
this — a Linux account that happens to be uid 1001, a CI runner, an LDAP or
NFS-mapped home directory, or network-attached storage.

The usual fix is to chown the host directories to `1000:1000`. When you cannot
— shared storage, an owner you do not control, or a uid policy you cannot
change — set `OPENCLAW_PUID`/`OPENCLAW_PGID` instead. Both `openclaw-gateway`
and `openclaw-cli` run as `"${OPENCLAW_PUID:-1000}:${OPENCLAW_PGID:-1000}"`, so
leaving them unset reproduces the previous default byte for byte, and the
Gateway refuses to start if you set `OPENCLAW_PUID=0` — root is never allowed.

### Find the uid and gid

Run `stat -c '%u %g' /path/to/openclaw-config` on the mounted directory itself,
or `id <user>` for the account that owns it. If you cannot get a shell on the
host, start the container once with the defaults and read the numeric hint
`openclaw doctor` prints on an ownership mismatch (`Owner mismatch (uid ...).
Run: sudo chown -R <uid>:<gid> ...`) — that names the exact uid and gid the
mounted directory is owned by.

With `scripts/docker/setup.sh`, put them in the environment and the script
validates them (decimal only, `0` rejected, max `65533`) and writes them to
`.env`. Without the script, set them in `.env` directly or in the compose file
you deploy.

### Example: a GUI container manager with no shell access

Some hosts only expose a compose editor — a NAS appliance such as Synology's
Container Manager is the common case. The recipe below is self-contained: it
pulls the published image, needs no repo checkout, and hard-codes the values
that the repo's own `docker-compose.yml` would otherwise read from `.env`.

Replace `1026:100` with your own uid:gid, `/volume1/docker/openclaw/...` with
your own directory paths, `REPLACE_WITH_A_LONG_RANDOM_TOKEN` with a real token,
and `<host-ip>` with the LAN IP or hostname you will browse to. Pre-create the
three host directories and chown them to your uid:gid before starting — the
container cannot create top-level bind-mount directories it does not own.
All three must be mounted: the auth-profile secret directory holds credentials
that would otherwise be lost every time the container is replaced.

```yaml
services:
  openclaw-gateway:
    image: ghcr.io/openclaw/openclaw:latest
    user: "1026:100" # replace with the output of `id <user>`
    environment:
      HOME: /home/node
      OPENCLAW_HOME: /home/node
      XDG_CACHE_HOME: /home/node/.openclaw/cache
      NPM_CONFIG_CACHE: /home/node/.openclaw/.npm
      OPENCLAW_PUID: "1026" # lets the Gateway refuse an accidental OPENCLAW_PUID=0
      OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR: /home/node/.openclaw
      OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH: /home/node/.openclaw/openclaw.json
      OPENCLAW_CONFIG_DIR: /home/node/.openclaw
      OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE_DIR: /home/node/.openclaw/workspace
      OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_PORT: "18789"
      OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN: "REPLACE_WITH_A_LONG_RANDOM_TOKEN"
    volumes:
      - /volume1/docker/openclaw/config:/home/node/.openclaw
      - /volume1/docker/openclaw/workspace:/home/node/.openclaw/workspace
      - /volume1/docker/openclaw/auth-profile-secrets:/home/node/.config/openclaw
    ports:
      - "18789:18789"
    command: ["node", "dist/index.js", "gateway", "--bind", "lan", "--port", "18789"]
    cap_drop:
      - NET_RAW
      - NET_ADMIN
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true
    init: true
    restart: unless-stopped
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "node", "dist/docker-healthcheck.js"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5
      start_period: 20s
```

On first boot, run the same onboarding and config-set commands as the
[manual flow](/install/docker#manual-flow), substituting your project's
service name for `openclaw-gateway`. Include
`gateway.controlUi.allowedOrigins` in that config-set call, or add it
afterwards:

```bash
docker compose exec openclaw-gateway node dist/index.js \
  config set gateway.controlUi.allowedOrigins '["http://<host-ip>:18789"]'
```

### Reaching the Control UI from another host

`--bind lan` publishes the gateway on the LAN. The Gateway refuses a
non-loopback bind unless a shared secret is configured —
`OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` above satisfies that — and separately refuses a
non-loopback Control UI unless `gateway.controlUi.allowedOrigins` lists the
origins you'll browse from, which is why the config-set call above is
required before you can open the Control UI at `http://<host-ip>:18789/`.

<Warning>
A directory exposed as world-writable (`chmod 777`) is rejected outright for
non-bundled plugins — don't "fix" a permissions error that way. Chown to the
correct uid/gid instead.
</Warning>

### Limitations

- **The ssh sandbox backend and node pairing over ssh don't work at a custom uid.** `ssh` refuses to run for a uid with no `/etc/passwd` entry (`No user exists for uid <N>`), so both are unavailable once `OPENCLAW_PUID` is anything other than 1000. The image still installs `openssh-client` for the sandbox backend on the default uid.
- **Named volumes need a one-off ownership repair.** If you use `OPENCLAW_HOME_VOLUME`, repair its ownership once after first start:

  ```bash
  docker compose run --rm --user root --entrypoint sh openclaw-gateway -c 'chown -R <PUID>:<PGID> /home/node/.openclaw'
  ```

- **Changing the uid on an existing install** needs a host-side `chown -R` of the bind mounts to the new uid/gid first. Otherwise previously installed (non-bundled) plugins fail the ownership gate and get blocked.
- **Kubernetes ignores these variables.** The [Kubernetes manifests](/install/kubernetes) pin `runAsUser`/`runAsGroup` directly; `OPENCLAW_PUID`/`OPENCLAW_PGID` only apply to this Docker Compose setup.
- **Docker userns-remap or rootless Docker changes the host-side owner** of files the container writes, which changes what you'd need to chown. These instructions assume a normal, non-remapped Docker daemon.
- **Don't set `agents.defaults.sandbox.docker.user`.** OpenClaw already derives the agent sandbox container's user from the workspace owner; pinning it yourself disables that detection.

See [Storage and persistence](/install/docker/networking-and-storage#storage-and-persistence) for what else the mounted config directory holds.

## Image contents and security scanning

Runtime images contain production Node.js dependencies only. Release builds pin the base image by digest and apply current Debian security updates with `apt-get dist-upgrade`; the `-browser` variant installs the Chromium version pinned by its Playwright release.

Scanner totals can include Debian findings that the distribution marks `wont-fix`. To rebuild locally against current base and package metadata, run `docker build --pull -t openclaw:local .`.

## Weekly image refreshes

The `latest*`, `main*`, and `extended-stable*` moving tags are rebuilt weekly from the same tagged release source so they pick up current OS security updates between OpenClaw releases. Stable and extended-stable refreshes remain separate, and beta images are not rebuilt on this schedule.

Each refresh also publishes a dated tag such as `2026.8.1-r20260820` (plus `-slim` and `-browser` variants). Plain version tags and dated `-rYYYYMMDD` tags are immutable; pin either form when you do not want a deployment to follow a moving tag.

## Running on a VPS?
